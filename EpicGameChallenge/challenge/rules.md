# Epic Game Challenge
You need to create a card product and navbar equal to the [EpicGame Website](https://store.epicgames.com/es-ES/)
<br>
*you can choose the font style and sizes, I recommend to visit the website and find the most similar fonts and image*

### HTML-CSS AND BOOSTRAP

Remember the good practice
- $card:$ create 5 card (equals to the image in this challenge), the button does not need to move these cards
- $Navbar$: equals to the page,same hover and hamburger menu (could use component on internet or boostrap if not found information)

**DO NOT USE CSS FRAME-WORK**


### React

The difference is that you need to create a project (named my-project) and get the information by passing data to the component (using props) **Important!** need to create a method that calculate the price with discount (only receive the original price and the percentage of the discount) **At least 10 cards (only show 5 and with the button show the other 5 when the page is in full screen) remember the responsive design (when the page in on mobile you could show 3 by 3)**

good luck :)
